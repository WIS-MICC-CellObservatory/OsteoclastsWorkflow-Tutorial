# Incorporating Machine Learning Tools into Image Analysis Workflows using Fiji, Ilastik and StarDist  

## Overview

This repository include Material used during hands-on tutorial workshop given at the Israeli Society of Microscopy 2023 meeting: Presentation, Exercises and related image files. 

A typical image analysis workflow includes segmentation of regions and objects (eg nuclei or cells), measuring multiple features for objects and regions, and quantifying relations between objects. Fiji is an open-source software platform based on ImageJ and a collection of compatible plugins focusing on general purpose image analysis for life-sciences. It is scriptable and enables fast prototyping of image analysis workflows. Ilastik, StarDist and other Fiji plugins provide an easy way to exploits recent advances in machine-learning and deep-learning based algorithms as handy components for use within image analysis workflows. 
In this hands-on workshop we will introduce you to building image analysis workflows using Fiji, Ilastik and StarDist.

## Workshop outline:  

1. Nuclei segmentation using StarDist
2. Learn Ilastik, train Pixel classifier for Osteoclasts (OCL)
3. Use Ilastik from Fiji
4. Pixel > Objects  
5. Parent Child relation: BioVoxxel Object Inspector plugin
6. Measurements & QualityControl
7. Automation guidelines I:  Recordings > Single file macro
8. Automation guidelines II: Processing whole folder
9. Use Fiji macro to process a whole folder
